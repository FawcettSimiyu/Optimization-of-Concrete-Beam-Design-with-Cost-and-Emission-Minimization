# Optimization-of-Concrete-Beam-Design-with-Cost-and-Emission-Minimization
This project aims to optimize the design of concrete beams to minimize both cost and carbon emissions. The optimization considers various parameters, including beam width, height, concrete strength, rebar diameter, number of rebars, and stirrups.
